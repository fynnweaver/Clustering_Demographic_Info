# LL Mini-Project 3: Clustering Demographic Information

Third project at Lighthouse Labs bootcamp. An unsupervised learning project using bank customer information with a focus on the demographic data. Project included cleaning and clustering data, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and using radar plots to visualize and interpretation of clusters. Implemented and compared k-means, heirarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. Created a function to easily intake algorithm results and create a radar plot. Below is an example of one such plot showing k-means clustering:
